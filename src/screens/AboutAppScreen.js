          passed and presented to our professor, Mary Jane Lima. The said
          application took a lot of consideration and designing, specifically
          with the prototyping of the UI/UX aspect of it. Algorithmia is a
          playground that is presented with the use of a Graphical User
          Interface and is composed of 4 main concepts namely: Knapsack,
          Selection Sorting, TSP, and String Matching. This is the culmination
          of the lessons that was taught to the students comprising the said
          group by Professor Lima.
